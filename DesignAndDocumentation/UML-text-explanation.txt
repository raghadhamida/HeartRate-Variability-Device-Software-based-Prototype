UML Diagram Explanation

The User starts the Session, the isSessionOn bool in User then turns to true. 
The Session class keeps a History of Sessions in its private vector data structure. 
Session also uses PulseReading to read the pulse, 
and PulseReading accesses the CoherenceIndicator class through the setIndicator() function.

Note: the built-in Q classes QObject, QLabel, QTimer, and QMainwindow are used as well.
